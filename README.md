# 8-Bit-Von-Neumann-MicroComputer-in-Verilog
This project is a simple 8-bit microcomputer built using Verilog HDL, based on the Von Neumann architecture, where both program instructions and data share the same memory space. It includes a custom assembler written in Python and a demo program to simulate and verify the computer's functionality.
